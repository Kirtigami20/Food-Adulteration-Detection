🧪 FoodSensor: Community Food Adulteration Checking
Ensuring Public Health through IoT and AI Vision
FoodSensor is an end-to-end IoT solution designed to empower individuals to detect and prevent the consumption of adulterated food. By combining real-time hardware sensors with a machine-learning-powered web dashboard, the system identifies harmful substances and assesses food quality in everyday items like milk, water, fruits, and vegetables.

🌟 Project Overview
Food adulteration is a significant health risk. Our team from K J Somaiya Institute of Technology developed this project to leverage electronics, programming, and data analysis to foster a safer, more vigilant community.
